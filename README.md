## Project Description
<p>
The Smart Nation movement went from conceptualization to real action. The ZEA launched its fourth Data-Driven Smart Nation Competition in January 2017. The goal of the competition is to elicit innovative applications that exploit the publicly available government data (https://data.gov.sg/) to change the ways we live, learn and work.You can find a list of applications that were developed using the government on the website https://data.gov.sg/. However, the number of ways to use the data to make our nation smarter is only limited by your imagination!
</p>

<p>
The competition will last 11 weeks. The milestones are described below.
</p>

<li> At the end of the 2nd week, the ZEA wants to see proposals of applications with clear target users, application features, and market values. Your application must not be a simple presentation of data extracted from these databases. Instead, it should
have some clear benefits to users. The ZEA will veto any proposal that is not considered sufficiently challenging for the team to develop. As there are many tourist and weather-oriented application in the market, the ZEA will veto any applications whose major features are tourist or weather-oriented, unless the ZEA is convinced with your new ideas. </li>

<li> At the end of the 4th week, the ZEA wants to see a complete proposal of application functionalities and user scenarios. To determine whether the teams have technical skills to develop the proposed application, the ZEA also wants to see an initial design of the application. </li>

<li> At the end of the 9th week, the ZEA wants to see the complete system architecture, system design, and the initial application prototype. </li>

<li> At the end of the 11th week, the ZEA will invite all the participating teams to demonstrate their working application prototype to other teamsin the same class. </li>

<p>
Any application proposals are welcome! However, the participating teams are required to use government data APIs or other data APIs for real world data. The teams must obtain access to the data API through the government agency websites or other authorized data 
sources. Using more types of government data APIs or even other publicly available data APIs (e.g., Google Maps) is allowed. 
</p>

<p>
The applications can be regular desktop applications, mobile applications, or web applications. The ZEA has no preference over the types of applications. The applications will be judged by the innovative use of data as well as the quality of the milestone deliverables described in the Lab Manuals and the rigorous process that the teams follow 
through the competition.
